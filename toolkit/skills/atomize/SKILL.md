name: atomize
description: Use when the user wants to atomize a source document into draft Cortex notes — "atomize this doc", "turn this into atomic notes", or /atomize <source.md>. Distills each section into one-idea-per-note drafts (type, folder, tags, wikilinks) and writes them safely into _inbox/ via the cortex toolkit.

# Atomize a source into AI-distilled draft notes

You are the **AI layer** of the N1X Cortex atomize pipeline. The `cortex` toolkit is the deterministic engine; you do the distillation. Every file write goes through the toolkit — you only produce data.

## Procedure

1. **Resolve the source.** Confirm the source markdown path (under the vault's `Markdown/`). Build the CLI path to `toolkit/dist/cli.js` (run `npm run build` in `toolkit/` first if `dist/` is missing).

2. **Emit the plan.** Run `node <cli> atomize "<source.md>" --emit-json` from the vault dir. Parse the JSON: `segments`, `knownTypes`, `knownFolders`, `existing`, `statusFirst`, `lang`, `fields`.

3. **Distill each segment** into one or more atomic notes, following the methodology:
   - **Atomic — one idea per note.** If a segment covers two things that could change independently, split it into multiple notes (Pillar 1).
   - **Type:** choose from `knownTypes`. Only introduce a new type when none fits — and call it out in the preview.
   - **Folder:** route from `knownFolders` (match the vault's type→folder convention).
   - **Cold-vault fallback:** if `knownTypes`/`knownFolders` are empty, use the methodology's canonical vocabulary (types `concept/flow/rule/technical/error/security/ux/mvp/strategy`; folders `01-Concepts/ … 09-Strategy/`), localized to `lang` when set, and note in the preview that a new taxonomy is being seeded.
   - **Body:** rewrite into clean, structured natural language — not a copy of the source. For flow/process notes, add an *Implications for implementation* section.
   - **Connect:** add `[[wikilinks]]` to related sibling notes and to notes in `existing`. Dangling links are valid (Pillar 2).
   - **Never write *illustrative* wikilinks in a body.** The engine parses **every** `[[...]]` as a real link, so example syntax like `[[note-name]]` or `[[example]]` becomes a phantom orphan in the graph. Only link to notes that exist or that you are genuinely creating; to *describe* link syntax, write it in prose or as inline code (`` `[[note-name]]` ``), never as a bare `[[note-name]]`.
   - **Tags + language:** add `tags`; write in the vault's `lang`.
   - **No duplicates:** if a strong match already exists in `existing`, drop that note (the toolkit will also skip it).
   - **Update vs create vs skip.** For a segment that matches a note in `existing` *and adds information*: **read that note** (its `path`), produce a **conservative merged body** — integrate the new info, preserve ALL existing content, links, and human edits, keep every source citation and add the new one, and keep the note's `# Heading` — then emit it as `{ "action": "update", "targetPath": "<existing path>", "title", "body": "<full merged body incl. heading>" }`. If the existing note already covers the segment, leave it `skip` (don't churn). Only `create` (new) notes omit `action`/`targetPath`.

4. **Write the distilled specs** to a temp file `distilled.json`. The `notes` array holds two possible shapes — mix them freely:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "<emit.source>",
     "notes": [
       { "title": "...", "type": "...", "folder": "...", "tags": ["..."], "body": "...", "fromHeading": "..." },
       { "action": "update", "targetPath": "<existing note path>", "title": "...", "body": "<full merged body>" }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Create notes (first shape, no `action`/`targetPath`) become new `_inbox/` drafts. Update notes (second shape) merge into the existing note at `targetPath` in place.

5. **Apply autonomously.** Write `distilled.json`, then run `node <cli> atomize --apply distilled.json --write`. The toolkit creates new drafts under `_inbox/` and merges `update` notes in place. Print a compact summary (creates, updates with their targets, any skips) — this is information, not a checkpoint.

6. **Reassure + reversibility.** Tell the user what changed and that **every edited note was backed up** — any update is undoable with `cortex atomize --undo` (or via git). Updates skipped by the shrink guard are reported; re-run with `--force` only if the shrink is intended.

## Safety (enforced by the toolkit, but respect them)

- Dry-run is the default; only `--write` writes. Always preview before writing.
- **New notes** (creates) land only in `_inbox/<folder>/` as `status: draft` — they are never written as brand-new files into curated folders directly.
- **Source files** under `Markdown/` are never modified. Existing curated notes are only ever changed through the `update` path, which backs up each note before editing; every update is reversible with `cortex atomize --undo`.
- Citations are mandatory (the toolkit adds them); keep the `source` correct.
